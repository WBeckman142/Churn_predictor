# Churn_predictor 

## Project Overview  
The Churn_predictor project aims to build a customer churn‑prediction pipeline: using historical customer/data records from the Iranian Telecoms data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset), the pipeline applies data processing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and XGBoost to predict which customers are likely to leave (churn). This can help businesses predict customer loss and take action to retain customers.
